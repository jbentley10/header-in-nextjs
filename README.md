# Portfolio in NextJS
This is a project created to showcase NextJS, React Spring, and Ziet Now all working in harmony. It has evolved from a demo to my online portfolio. 

To install, open a Terminal or command prompt and run `yarn`. 

The package will install. Once it has completed, run `yarn dev` to spin up a localhost where you can work on the project.

NextJS and Yarn will automatically refresh the localhost page as you are working, so there's no need to recompile during development.

If you need to compile Tailwind's config file, run `gulp css` from a separate Terminal/command prompt window.
