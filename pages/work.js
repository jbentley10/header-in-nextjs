          Building a Website
          I volunteered to create a website for Pueblo Unido PDX, based
          on these brand guidelines.

          The process began with an intake meeting between myself 
          and the various stakeholders of Pueblo Unido PDX, such as 
          the executive director, board members, and other volunteers.

          We discussed what the website would need, and what the major
          calls to actions for users of the website would be.

          From there, I generated a visual 'comp' of the website. Once that
          comp was approved, I coded the website by hand using HTML+CSS.
