    <p className="image-text-split__text sm:text-xl text-base">As a kid growing up in England, I fell in love with technology. Even though we had to dial up to use the Internet back then, I patiently waited for those glorious pixels to show up on the screen.

    <p className="image-text-split__text sm:text-xl text-base">After graduating, I started to develop websites again in my spare time. I consider web design to be my main profession, but I have <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jwbentle" target="_blank" className="text-link-purple hover:text-link-purple-darker cursor-pointer">built my skills</a> in marketing campaign strategy, user experience, search engine optimization, and branding.</p>
